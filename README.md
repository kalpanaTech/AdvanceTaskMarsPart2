This project is an advanced automation test framework built using SpecFlow with Selenium WebDriver in C#. It follows the Page Object Model (POM), integrates JSON for test data, and uses Extent Reports with screenshots. The framework is clean, maintainable, component-based, and adheres to best practices.
